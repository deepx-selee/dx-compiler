This chapter describes various parameters required for compiling an ONNX model using the **DX_COM**. It includes input specifications, calibration methods, data preprocessing settings, and optional parameters for advanced compilation schemes.  

These parameters are defined in a JSON file, which serves as a blueprint for how the compiler interprets and processes the input model.

## Required Parameters  

### Inputs  

Defines the input name and shape of the ONNX model.  

!!! warning "Model Input Restrictions"
    - The batch size **must** be fixed to 1.  
    - **Only** a single input is supported when compiling from a JSON configuration with the `dxcom` command. For multi-input models, use the `dx_com` Python module with DataLoader (see [Python Wheel Package Usage](02_06_Execution_of_DX-COM.md#python-wheel-package-usage)).  
    - Input name **must** exactly match ONNX model definition.

Example  
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "input.1": [1, 3, 512, 512]
  }
}
```

In this example, `"input.1"` is the name of the input tensor and its shape is `[1, 3, 512, 512]`, where:

- `1`: batch size (**must be 1**)  
- `3`: number of channels (e.g., RGB)  
- `512 x 512`: image height and width

---

### Calibration Method  

Defines the calibration method used during quantization. It is essential for maintaining model accuracy after compilation by determining appropriate activation ranges.  

Available Methods  

- `ema`:  
  Uses exponential moving average of activation values.  
  Recommended for improved post-quantization accuracy.  

- `minmax`:  
  Uses the minimum and maximum activation values to determine quantization range.

Example
```json
{
  "calibration_method": "ema"
}
```

---

### Calibration Number

Defines the number of steps used during calibration. A higher number may improve quantization accuracy by better estimating activation ranges, but may also increase compile time.  

To minimize the accuracy degradation, it is recommended to try different values, such as 1, 5, 10, 100, or 1000, and determine the value that yields the best accuracy for your model.

Example
```json
{
  "calibration_num": 100
}
```

---

### Calibration Data Loading

You must provide calibration data using the `default_loader` parameter, which specifies the dataset location, accepted file types, and preprocessing steps:

```json
{
  "default_loader": {
    "dataset_path": "/datasets/ILSVRC2012",
    "file_extensions": ["jpeg", "png", "jpg", "JPEG"],
    "preprocessings": [
      {"resize": {"width": 224, "height": 224}},
      {"normalize": {"mean": [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], "std": [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]}}
    ]
  }
}
```

For all available preprocessing operations, see [Appendix: Preprocessing Operations Reference](#appendix-preprocessing-operations-reference).

**For Multi-Input Models or Non-Image Data**  

If you need to compile multi-input models or provide non-image data, use the `dx_com` Python module with torch DataLoader instead of JSON configuration. See [Python Wheel Package Usage](02_06_Execution_of_DX-COM.md#python-wheel-package-usage).  

---

## Optional Parameters: Quantization Device

Specifies the device used for quantization during compilation. By default, DX-COM automatically detects available hardware and uses GPU if a CUDA-compatible GPU is available, otherwise falls back to CPU. You can override this behavior by explicitly setting the device.

Available Values

- Not specified (Default): Auto-detect. Uses GPU if available, otherwise CPU.
- `"cpu"`: Force CPU quantization.
- `"cuda"`: Use the default CUDA GPU.
- `"cuda:N"`: Use a specific GPU (e.g., `"cuda:0"`, `"cuda:1"`).

Example
```json
{
  "quantization_device": "cuda:0"
}
```

!!! warning "Hardware Requirements"
    - **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.
    - **Framework**: PyTorch built with CUDA support (`torch.cuda.is_available()` must return `True`).

For practical examples, see [Use Case 5: Enhanced Quantization (DXQ)](04_04_Common_Use_Cases.md#use-case-5-enhanced-quantization-dxq).

---

## Optional Parameters: Enhanced Quantization Scheme (DXQ)

!!! note "Version Support"
    DXQ (`enhanced_scheme`) is supported in **DX-COM v2.1.0 and later**.

When quantizing a model, accuracy degradation may occur compared to the original model. To mitigate this, **Q-PRO options** (DXQ-P0 to DXQ-P5) can be used to enhance quantization performance.  

!!! note "Prefer automatic selection?"
    The DXQ schemes below are the **manual** Q-PRO interface. To let DX-COM pick the DXQ combination for you, use the compile-time `--use_q_pro` flag instead — see [Automatic Q-PRO (`use_q_pro`)](02_06_Execution_of_DX-COM.md#automatic-q-pro-use_q_pro). Automatic Q-PRO and a manual `enhanced_scheme` are mutually exclusive.

| Name | Compilation Speed | Accuracy Improvement |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| DXQ-P0 | Very Fast | Low |
| DXQ-P1 | Very Slow | Low-Middle |
| DXQ-P2 | Quite Slow | Middle-High |
| DXQ-P3 | Very Slow | High |
| DXQ-P4 | Very Slow | High |
| DXQ-P5 | Very Slow | High |

!!! note "Recommendation"
    **Best Accuracy**: DXQ-P3 and DXQ-P4 generally offer better accuracy, so try them first.  
    
    **GPU Acceleration**: DXQ schemes (especially P1~P5) are computationally intensive. Using `quantization_device="cuda"` can reduce compilation time by **2-5x** compared to CPU. 
    See [Use Case 5: Enhanced Quantization (DXQ)](04_04_Common_Use_Cases.md#use-case-5-enhanced-quantization-dxq) for examples.  

!!! warning "Limitations"
    Results are **not guaranteed** to improve accuracy. Results may vary depending on the model and dataset.


**DXQ-P0**  
Uses an alpha value to control the strength of the quantization enhancement.

```json
{
  "enhanced_scheme": {
    "DXQ-P0": {
      "alpha": 0.5
    }
  }
}
```

**DXQ-P1**  
Enables a simple quantization improvement strategy.

```json
{
  "enhanced_scheme": {
    "DXQ-P1": true
  }
}
```

**DXQ-P2**  
Uses a more refined strategy with `alpha`, `beta`, and `cosim_num` parameters.

```json
{
  "enhanced_scheme": {
    "DXQ-P2": {
      "alpha": 0.1,
      "beta": 1.0,
      "cosim_num": 2
    }
  }
}
```

**DXQ-P3, DXQ-P4, DXQ-P5**  
Support the optional `num_samples` parameter. Recommended value: 1024.

```json
{
  "enhanced_scheme": {
    "DXQ-P3": {
      "num_samples": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

## Optional Parameters: PPU Configuration

The Post-Processing Unit (PPU) is a hardware module inside the NPU for accelerating selected post-processing steps in supported object detection models. The `ppu` configuration section exists to enable this hardware path and provide the parameters required to use it.

!!! warning "Deprecation Notice — PPU Type 2"
    Starting with DX-Compiler **v2.4.0**, `ppu.type = 2` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. See the [Type 2](#type-2-dfl-based-anchor-free-models-cpu-side-topk-optimization) section below. 
    `type = 0` and `type = 1` still configure PPU hardware paths. `type = 2` is different: it does **not** use the PPU hardware. Instead, it enables an additional CPU-side TopK-based optimization flow for compatible DFL-based YOLO models. 

These configurations can automate or optimize the following operations:  

- **Confidence Filtering (`type = 0`, `type = 1`)**: Removal of detection candidates below a specified threshold through the PPU hardware path.  
- **Class Prediction (`type = 0`, `type = 1`)**: Execution of Argmax-style class selection per detection through the PPU hardware path.  
- **TopK Candidate Reduction (`type = 2`)**: CPU-side selection of the highest-scoring candidates to reduce the work required in later CPU-side decoding and filtering stages for supported DFL-based YOLO models.  

!!! warning "IMPORTANT"  
    **NMS** (Non-Maximum Suppression) is not supported by the PPU hardware and must still be executed on the host CPU after compilation using the filtered model outputs.  

---

### Operational Guidelines  

Before using the `ppu` configuration, verify that your model architecture and system requirements align with the following criteria:  

Recommended Use Cases (Enable)  

- **Model Compatibility:** Optimized for the YOLO family and similar object detection architectures.  
- **Hardware Constraints:** Highly recommended for edge devices with limited CPU overhead.  
- **Performance Goals:** Necessary for real-time applications requiring high FPS (Frames Per Second).  

Non-Supported Scenarios (Disable)  

- **Classification Models:** (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet) These models do not require the filtering logic provided by the PPU.  
- **Segmentation Models:** (e.g., DeepLab, U-Net) These rely on pixel-level mask processing, which is incompatible with PPU logic.  
- **Custom Architectures:** Any model utilizing a detection head that does not align with standard YOLO-style output tensors.  

---

### Performance Impact  

The performance effect depends on the selected PPU type. `type = 0` and `type = 1` reduce CPU-side detection work through the PPU hardware path, while `type = 2` improves CPU-side post-processing efficiency by shrinking the candidate set before the heavier CPU-side DFL-based decoding and later filtering stages.  

| PPU Mode | Primary Effect | Expected Benefit |
|------|------|------|
| Disabled | All post-processing remains on the host CPU | Higher CPU workload |
| `type = 0` / `type = 1` | The compiled model uses the PPU path for filtering and class prediction | Lower CPU utilization and lower end-to-end latency |
| `type = 2` | TopK and the later decoding/filtering stages remain on the host CPU; TopK reduces the number of candidates processed later | Reduced CPU post-processing complexity and improved runtime efficiency |

---

### Configuration Parameters  

| Type | Architecture | Supported Models |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| 0 | Anchor-Based | YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv7 |
| 1 | Anchor-Free | YOLOX, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, YOLOv11, YOLOv12 |
| 2 | DFL-Based Anchor-Free | YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv11, YOLOv12 (optional CPU-side TopK optimization path; **deprecated in v2.4.0** — use [`dx_com.pre_optimize()`](04_03_Pre_Optimize_API.md) instead) |

---

### Type 0: Anchor-Based YOLO Models

```json
{
  "ppu": {
    "type": 0,
    "conf_thres": 0.25,
    "activation": "Sigmoid",

---

### Type 1: Anchor-Free Models

**YOLOX Example:**

  "ppu": {
    "type": 1,
    "conf_thres": 0.25,
    "num_classes": 80,

      {"bbox": "output_bbox_1", "obj_conf": "output_obj_1", "cls_conf": "output_cls_1"},
      {"bbox": "output_bbox_2", "obj_conf": "output_obj_2", "cls_conf": "output_cls_2"},
      {"bbox": "output_bbox_3", "obj_conf": "output_obj_3", "cls_conf": "output_cls_3"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**YOLOv8/v9/v10/v11/v12 Example:**

      {"bbox": "Mul_441", "cls_conf": "Sigmoid_442"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Parameters:

    - `bbox`: Bounding box output layer
    - `obj_conf`: Object confidence layer
    - `cls_conf`: Class confidence layer

---

### Type 2: DFL-Based Anchor-Free Models (CPU-Side TopK Optimization)

!!! warning "Deprecated in v2.4.0"

    `ppu.type = 2` is **deprecated** as of DX-Compiler v2.4.0 and will be removed in a future release. New projects should use the [`dx_com.pre_optimize()` API](04_03_Pre_Optimize_API.md), which provides the same TopK-first optimization (and adds support for instance segmentation and YOLO26). Compiling a model with PPU type 2 still works in v2.4.0 but emits a deprecation warning. See [Migration from PPU Type 2](04_03_Pre_Optimize_API.md#migration-from-ppu-type-2) for the replacement recipe.

`ppu.type = 2` is an optional CPU-side TopK optimization path for compatible DFL-based anchor-free YOLO models. It does **not** use the PPU hardware. Post-processing still runs on the CPU, and TopK is also performed on the CPU. By reducing the number of candidate boxes that continue into later CPU-side DFL-based decoding and filtering stages, this option reduces post-processing complexity and improves runtime efficiency.

This option is intended for DFL-based YOLO families that expose separate per-scale `bbox` and `cls_conf` head nodes. It is an optional CPU-side optimization path in addition to the standard anchor-free PPU configuration. In internal validation for DX-COM v2.3.0, this path was compile-verified with YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12 variants using compatible head mappings. YOLOv10 is not supported — its `one2one` decoupled head is incompatible with PPU type 2; use `yolo26_postprocess` via [`dx_com.pre_optimize()`](04_03_Pre_Optimize_API.md) instead.

```json
{
  "ppu": {
    "type": 2,
    "topk": 512,
    "num_classes": 80,
    "layer": [
      {"bbox": "bbox_head_p3", "cls_conf": "cls_head_p3"},
      {"bbox": "bbox_head_p4", "cls_conf": "cls_head_p4"},
      {"bbox": "bbox_head_p5", "cls_conf": "cls_head_p5"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Parameters:

- `type`: Set to `2` to compile the CPU-side TopK-optimized flow
- `topk`: Number of candidates kept before later decoding stages
    - If omitted, DX-COM uses the internal default value
    - `512` is a practical starting point for validated YOLO examples
- `num_classes`: Number of detection classes
- `layer`: List of per-scale detection head mappings
    - `bbox`: Final bbox head node name for a detection scale
    - `cls_conf`: Final class-confidence head node name for the same scale

Use this option only when the model head structure is compatible with this workflow. A DFL-based output is important, but it is not the only requirement. You must also provide correct per-scale `bbox` and `cls_conf` node mappings in the JSON configuration.

---

### Implementation: Identifying ONNX Node Names

To configure PPU, you need to identify specific node names in your ONNX model:

**Step 1.** Open your model in [Netron](https://netron.app) to visualize the ONNX graph

**Step 2-1.** For Type 0 (Anchor-based YOLO):

- Trace backwards from model outputs to locate detection head Conv layers
- These Conv layers output feature maps with shape `[1, num_anchors*(5+num_classes), H, W]`
- Example node names in YOLOv7: `/model.105/m.0/Conv`, `/model.105/m.1/Conv`, `/model.105/m.2/Conv`

![Figure. YOLOv7 detection head showing the three Conv layers (highlighted in red)](./../resources/yolov7-class-n2-ppu.png){ width=600px }

**Step 2-2.** For Type 1 (standard anchor-free PPU path, YOLOX example):

- Find three types of Conv nodes for each detection scale: `bbox`, `obj_conf`, `cls_conf`
- This results in 9 Conv layers total (3 scales × 3 branches)

![Figure. YOLOX Multi-Scale Detection Head Architecture](./../resources/YOLOX-head.png){ width=600px }

**Step 2-3.** For Type 1 (YOLOv8 and later):

- Trace backwards from the final `Concat` operation
- Identify `bbox` (often from `Mul` or `Add`) and `cls_conf` (often from `Sigmoid`)
- Use the node names that match the `layer` format required by `type = 1`

![Figure. YOLOv8 Detection Head Architecture](./../resources/YOLOV8-head.png){ width=350px }

**Step 2-4.** For Type 2 (CPU-side TopK optimization path):

- Inspect the ONNX tail and locate the final per-scale bbox and class head nodes
- Identify three detection scales and pair the matching `bbox` and `cls_conf` nodes for each scale
- For validated examples, the correct nodes were the final Conv nodes in the decoupled head branches
- Some models may already include TopK-style operations in the ONNX tail, but you should still map the compatible per-scale `bbox` / `cls_conf` nodes for the `type = 2` configuration

## Appendix: Preprocessing Operations Reference

The following preprocessing operations can be applied to input data when using `default_loader`. These operations help standardize input formats and ensure consistency between calibration and deployment.

!!! warning "Automatic Preprocessing Optimization"
    To maximize performance, the compiler may automatically integrate specific preprocessing operations directly into the NPU execution graph. This hardware-level integration reduces host CPU load and minimizes data transfer latency.  

    Optimization depends on input data types and model architecture; therefore, integration **is not guaranteed** for all operations.  

    **How to Verify and Optimize:**

    After compilation, inspect the compilation logs for `[INFO] - Added nodes: messages.` This indicates which operations have been offloaded to the NPU.  

    **1. Identify Integrated Nodes:**

    Check your log for entries similar to the following: `[INFO] - Added nodes: ['Normalize', 'Cast', 'Transpose']`

    ```
    [INFO] - Added nodes: Div(x=255) -> Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ```

    **2. Update Runtime Code:**

    If an operation is listed in the "Added nodes" log, it is now handled by the NPU hardware. You must remove these operations from your host-side runtime code to prevent redundant processing and performance degradation.  

    | Status in Log | Action Required | Result |
    |------|------|------|
    | Node Added | Remove from Host Code | Hardware Acceleration Enabled |
    | Node Not Added | Keep in Host Code | Software Preprocessing (CPU) |

    ```python
    # If preprocessing is NOT integrated into NPU:
    img = img / 255.0
    normalized = (img - mean) / std
    output = model.run(normalized)

    # If preprocessing IS integrated into NPU (log shows "Added nodes"):
    output = model.run(img)  # Skip preprocessing - NPU handles it automatically
    ```

**convertColor**  

Changes the color channel order of input images.  

```json
{"convertColor": {"form": "BGR2RGB"}}
```

Supported values: `RGB2BGR`, `BGR2RGB`, `RGB2GRAY`, `BGR2GRAY`, `RGB2YCrCb`, `BGR2YCrCb`, `RGB2YUV`, `BGR2YUV`, `RGB2HSV`, `BGR2HSV`, `RGB2LAB`, `BGR2LAB`

**resize**  

Resizes input image to a specified target size.  

```json
{"resize": {"mode": "default", "width": 320, "height": 320, "interpolation": "LINEAR"}}
```

| Mode | Supported Interpolation Methods |
|------|--------------------------------|
| `default` (OpenCV) | `LINEAR`, `NEAREST`, `CUBIC`, `AREA`, `LANCZOS4` |
| `torchvision` (PIL) | `BILINEAR`, `NEAREST`, `BICUBIC`, `LANCZOS` |

**centercrop**  

Crops the central region of the input image.  

```json
{"centercrop": {"width": 224, "height": 224}}
```

**transpose**  

Rearranges tensor dimensions.  

```json
{"transpose": {"axis": [0, 2, 3, 1]}}
```

**expandDim**  

Adds a new dimension at the specified axis.  

```json
{"expandDim": {"axis": 0}}
```

**normalize**  

Normalizes input data by mean and standard deviation. This operation may be integrated into the NPU graph during compilation (see [NPU Integration](#appendix-preprocessing-operations-reference) above).  

```json
{"normalize": {"mean": [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], "std": [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]}}
```

**mul, add, subtract, div**  

Arithmetic operations on input data. The `subtract` and `div` operations may be integrated into the NPU graph during compilation (see [NPU Integration](#appendix-preprocessing-operations-reference) above).  

```json
{"mul": {"x": 255}}
{"add": {"x": 128}}
{"subtract": {"x": 127}}
{"div": {"x": 255}}
```

---

## Appendix: Custom Loader (Legacy)

!!! warning "Deprecation Notice"
    The Custom Loader approach is **deprecated**. For new projects, use the [Python wheel package with torch DataLoader](02_06_Execution_of_DX-COM.md#python-wheel-package-usage) instead, which provides more flexibility and better integration with Python workflows.

For legacy projects that still require Custom Loader, download the [Custom Dataloader Guide](http://cs.deepx.ai/_deepx_fae_archive/docs/Custom_Dataloader_Guide_241204.zip) for detailed instructions.
