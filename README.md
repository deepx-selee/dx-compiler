# DEEPX DX-Compiler

## DXNN® - DEEPX NPU SDK (DX-AS: DEEPX All-Suite)

**DX-AS (DEEPX All-Suite)** is an integrated environment of frameworks and tools that enables inference and compilation of AI models using DEEPX devices. Users can build the integrated environment by installing individual tools, but DX-AS maintains optimal compatibility by aligning the versions of the individual tools.

## [AI Model Compile Environment](https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx-compiler) (Compiler Platform)

**Purpose**  
  - Must be installed on the Host machine that will perform the compilation (converting) of ONNX models to our proprietary DXNN (DEEPX format).  

**Core Components**
  - DX-COM: Converts ONNX models into highly optimized, NPU-ready binaries.

**Flexibility & Support**
  - OS: Compatible with Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04, 26.04 (Debian-based), Fedora 42-45, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9-10, and CentOS Stream 9-10
  - Python: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
  - Architecture: Supports x86_64 only

**Easy Installation**
  - Our single script automates the full setup process
  - All DX-Compiler components are ready to use upon completion.

**Beta Features (v2.4.0)**
  - **Agent-Driven Development (dx-agent-dev)**: Compile ONNX models using natural language prompts. AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex CLI) understand the DX-COM pipeline and generate deployment-ready `.dxnn` models with automatic verification. See the 
    [Agent-Driven Development Guide](./source/docs/06_DX-COMPILER_Agent_Driven_Development.md) for details.

## Create User Manual

### Install Python Dependencies

To install the necessary Python packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-video pymdown-extensions mkdocs-to-pdf 
```

### Generate Documentation (HTML and PDF)

To generate the user guide as both HTML and PDF files, execute the following command:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will create:
- **HTML documentation** in the `docs/` folder - open `docs/index.html` in your web browser
- **PDF file**: `DEEPX_DX-COM_UM_[version]_[release_date].pdf` in the root directory
